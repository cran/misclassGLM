Description: Estimates models that extend the standard GLM to take
    misclassification into account. The models require side information from a secondary data set
    on the misclassification process, i.e. some sort of misclassification
    probabilities conditional on some common covariates.
    A detailed description of the algorithm can be found in
    Dlugosz, Mammen and Wilke (2015) <https://ftp.zew.de/pub/zew-docs/dp/dp15043.pdf>.
